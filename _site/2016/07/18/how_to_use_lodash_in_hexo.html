<p>Hexo Themes support <a href="">lodash</a> out of the box! Lodash is a library that
offers functions inspired by the functional paradigm. However, if you
try to use Hexo variable that you would expect to be lists, like
<code>site.pages</code> you will be unpleasently suprised. </p>

<p>A quick inspection of the keys <code>site.pages</code> will reveal there to be only
2 keys: <code>length</code> and <code>data</code>. No List/Array! It appears that the methods that
ship with the pages object like <code>site.pages.first()</code> or
<code>site.pages.each()</code>, use the <code>data</code> value in there implementation. This
means if you want to just work on a list using something like lodash,
you need to use <code>data</code> yourself.</p>

<p>For example, I wanted to use lodash&#39;s <a href="https://lodash.com/docs#find"><code>_.find(collection, predicate)</code></a> function on <code>site.pages</code>. This is how I did it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">_.find(site.pages.data, function(p){return p.title = &quot;hellodash&quot;})._content
</code></pre></div>
