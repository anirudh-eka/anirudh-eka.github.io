<p>Coconut trees launch from the earth like rockets hurtling towards<br>
American fighter jets flying above, but explode prematurely into an<br>
umbrella of branches and leaves. Inside a ring of observers, a monk sits<br>
in lotus position on the street, as another empties a five gallon<br>
canister of petroleum onto him. He lights a match stick over his lap and<br>
let&#39;s go.</p>

<p>The hungry little fire chews at the wood as the match plummets towards a<br>
surface full of oil like a bomb over Iraq. Like these places are meant<br>
to burn.</p>

<p>An act of &quot;protest&quot; for the war.</p>

<p><span style='display: none;'>&lt;!--more--&gt;</span><br>
Dear Monk,</p>

<p>You can&#39;t protest entropy? I&#39;m a fucking law of physics.<br>
I am become death, the destroyer worlds<br>
I am closer to you humans than your fingers.<br>
I see your foes through a drones camera<br>
As I extend my arms with bullet fingers towards children<br>
and they become what their lives are touched by:<br>
Hallow shells<br>
Some move like bullets never meant to be released<br>
Aimless, but bound for destruction.<br>
While others come back with the precision of airplanes.<br>
And you always seem surprised!<br>
See what you humans seem to not understand is, when it comes to the<br>
evolution of warfare, bullets are not the children of arrows, but the<br>
descendants of boomerangs.</p>

<p>But, before you jump to any conclusions,<br>
Know that I am not evil.<br>
Just tired from hoping.<br>
If only you could see Humanity the way that I do.<br>
As my daughter, laid out, shuddering, screaming stop the pain in<br>
billions of voices.<br>
She&#39;s been suffering from this disease since birth and it is genetic.<br>
It is me in her, but I also see me in her heart beat.<br>
In the willingness for humans to thrive.<br>
I used to believe your capacity for self reflection,<br>
your ingenuity, your creativity could save Humanity!<br>
I used to thought your technology would bring you closer,<br>
but time has proven that the distance between human hearts cannot be<br>
created nor destroyed.<br>
It is a law of physics!<br>
A force stronger than gravity for you featherless creatures learned how<br>
to fly,<br>
but couldn&#39;t resist letting bombs fall on a planet you&#39;ve ripped apart<br>
out of<br>
fear of other<br>
fear of ugly<br>
fear of uncertainty<br>
fear of death<br>
you are killing yourself.</p>

<p>When it comes to the evolution of your species, human beings are not the<br>
children of apes, but the descendants of fire. They don&#39;t know how to<br>
not be hungry regardless of how much they&#39;ve consumed.</p>

<p>I watch as Humanity absently abandons her hand in a flame and then<br>
screams from the pain. And I know Monk, you are her finger staring back<br>
through the fire, refusing to abandon her. <br>
You sit impossibly still defying what feels like a law of physics.<br>
A symbol for the overwhelming majority of people in<br>
Iraq, Kashmir, Palestine<br>
Who refuse war when it walks through their streets,<br>
selling revenge as a cool breeze after scorching their homes.<br>
In a context like that, choosing to live some semblance of a normal life<br>
is more than an act of non violent resistance.<br>
It is a reversal of time<br>
It is growing from skepticism to innocence<br>
It is returning to mothers<br>
It is becoming start dust<br>
It is knowing that empathy is Humanity&#39;s nervous system<br>
It is refusing to abandon humanity to the disease of Fear that paralyzes<br>
her from feeling her own suffering in places like Saigon.<br>
It is Humanity&#39;s heart,<br>
still beating</p>

<p>But, there is a moment in torture when the beating heart ceases to be<br>
ones ally and becomes a weapon of ones tormentor.</p>

<p>Let go Monk. It is hopeless.</p>

<p>After all, a picture of your sacrifice was awarded the Pulitzer prize<br>
because of the way it could stop a bullet in mid air.<br>
But it could not stop the war.</p>
