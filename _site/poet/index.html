          <p>Anirudh ‘Eka’ is a poet born in Hyderabad, India and raised in Minnesota and North Carolina. Eka can't remember when he really "started" writing poetry, but his affair with spoken word began in 2008. As a founding member of <a href='http://sacrificialpoets.org/'> Sacrificial Poets</a>, the North Carolina Youth Slam Team, he joined them on their first trip to Brave New Voices in Washington, DC. Since then Eka has featured in several venues across North Carolina, Atlanta, London, New York and Washington, D.C. He is humbled by every moment an ear has given him because words are just sounds coming out of mouths until someone chooses to give them meaning. To him, the listener is the artist, the poet just brings the paint.</p>

                <p><p>There is a tension between the individual and the collective. I don’t just mean between capitalism and socialism. I mean between following the heart and following what community asks. Whether on the topic of marriage or career, the individual must always consider the family interests. It is a tension between what you owe to yourself and what you owe to others.</p>

<p>But what is this heart we follow? Is it the heart that is myopic, that chases every desire and vanity? Is it the one that will always put its own interests over its faithfulness to another?</p>

<p>Or is the heart something else? Is it the one that knows its pulse? Is it the one that seeks self-actualization? Is it the one that if suppressed will chip away at a person’s passion to live? Does that heart even exist?</p>
