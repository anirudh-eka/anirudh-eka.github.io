  <div class="post align-">
  <p>When I landed, the humidity barged through the air conditioned Delhi airport and into my nostrils warning of the fast approaching country. I couldn&#39;t believe ThoughtWorks, my company, was sending me to India, the country I was born in, to attend a 5 week training course for new entry level hires from across the world. I felt like I was getting away with a crime. </p>

<p>After a lay over and a domestic flight to Pune, I was on my way to Koregon Park, the neighborhood where I&#39;d be living for the next 5 weeks. Through stop and go traffic, I glimpsed cocunut trees shoot up like rockets into the sky bursting into a plethora of branches. In the morning I watched a blood sunrise through humid air and listened to subtropical birds sing. In every trip, this is the way India begins for me. I land sometime at night and thanks to jet lag, I witness life unravel starting with the bird song. But this time something was missing. I couldn&#39;t pin point what it was. The old curtains lifted but the show was not the same. This post is an attempt at explaining this difference and why it bothered me so much.</p>

<p>Koregon Park is a posh neighborhood near the major tech companies in the city. It&#39;s a 15 minute shuttle ride to the ThoughtWorks office, which is situated in an area full of tall, clean, well organized buildings that could&#39;ve immigrated from the West. I heard about places like this before. Tech companies have had a large and lasting presence in Hyderabad, the city I often visit and where most of my family is, but I never spent time in that world. And it really is a different world. Audis and BMWs were standard. The Indian residents dressed in a camoflouge that made them indistinguishable from the expats roaming the street. The neighborhood had more Italian restraunts than Indian ones. I think it&#39;s possible for someone to fly into Pune, live in Koregon park, and go to work in one of the big IT companies down the road without ever seeing a cow in the street! </p>

<p>I found myself often saying, &quot;this isn&#39;t the real India.&quot; I hated that phrase, as if there is a way India should be. Yet, I felt the urge to show the foreignors on my trip that most of India doesn&#39;t live with undisturbed electricity and water. But is India supposed to be a poor country? Certainly that&#39;s what I was implying. Koregon Park like so much of &quot;hip&quot; India is trying to be western so bad that it hurts. It offers bars, western restraunts, Hard Rock Cafe, clubs as if yelling to the foreignors (and the rich locals) that India is cool too! You can have a good time here! Sure India can offer that, but it can also offer so much more. Things you couldn&#39;t find anywhere else in the world. If the experience you&#39;re looking for is to go to a subtropical place to party and drink then I&#39;d suggest going to Miami.</p>

<p>India&#39;s soul is still somewhere in a village or a jungle where electricity and water is scarce and siphened for the wealthy in the city enforcing an artificial belief that these resources are infinite. Maharashtra, the state Pune is in, was grappling with the effects of the 2013 drought, which the government claimed had surpassed the historically cruel drought of 1972. However, <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-drought-manmade-analysis/article4577079.ece">unequal distribution of water by the state through dams</a>, which prioritizes..., also deserves blame for causing a desperate situation for rural people. But in the places I lived, the drought seemed like it was in a far away country. The hotels of Pune and surrounding areas offered swimming pools and free bottled water, while farmers beg the clouds for drops and commit suicide not too far away.</p>

<p>If I sound depressing, it is because the situation is depressing. I&#39;m fully aware my actions, in fact sheer amount of resources I required to live a semblance of a first world life in a third world country contradicts all of my preaching. But that&#39;s my point. I want people to feel the guilt of first world privelages and the hypocrisy of claiming to live a just life in an unjust world, when they come to India. For there to be rich, there must be poor and India, like any developing country, can show what exactly is the cost of comfort. But on this trip, I saw how the tech scene tries to hide the rest of the country from its guests.</p>

<p>Still, Koregon Park is in India. Tin roofed shaks sit across a river from the Westin Hotel. Material disparity is still not nearly as hidden from the rich or the poor as it is in the US. When I landed in Chicago at the end of my trip, I saw another Westin Hotel, but this time without the slums of the city to accompany it. The gated community of America keeps the guilt of privelage at bay. I appreciate that India doesn&#39;t as much, but I fear it will.</p>

<p>But what what was missing from the mornings at Koregon Park wasn&#39;t poverty per se, but something linked. Something that became apparent as I watched the morning unfold at my grandparent&#39;s home in Hyderabad. Chasing the morning bird song, a distant call to prayer echoed from a Masjid and, bells rang in temples and homes as poojas welcomed the sunrise. This is what I love about India. The day begins for all creatures of the city. Women pour water in front of houses, and lay chalk powder designs on the ground. Shop keepers perform rituals with their merchandise praying for a good &quot;harvest&quot;. In the park, old men practice Yoga and meditation. God, an essential part of Indian culture, was what was missing from Koregon Park. In my time there I did not see a single religious institution. (I don&#39;t count Osha Ashram.) I personally am not religous, but I am always facinated by how spiritual traditions in India, of which there are millions, lace through all aspects of society and life. If there is anything that ties the people to their earth, you can feel it in these traditions. The cycles of the days, seasons, lives, eons are painted into ritual and festival.</p>

<p>It is possible that Koregon Park was always like how it is. But it feels as though when they developed the area to attract the rich and the foreignors, they gentrified God out of the neighborhood. In its place they built restraunts that serve pork and beef handled by brown people who could very likely be Muslims or Hindus. But money is God in the flesh. It has the power to make an IT office in the subtropics feel like a winter in Chicago. With the (unequal) advance of modern technology into India, more and more Indians are being able to control their world. Cars, air conditioning, washing machines, hydroelctric dams are making the earth more of a slave than a god. My issue with Koregon Park, I suppose, is really an issue with a grander march of our species to control our environment.</p>

<p>Though urbanizing rapidly, India is still mostly an Agrarian society with a rural population of nearly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_India">70%</a>. It is the communal lifestyle of the village, which penetrates into city life as well, that makes the country&#39;s culture so distinct from the West. </p>

<p>I write code. I&#39;m at the forefront of the human crusade to control. I continuously strive to make the consumer&#39;s experience smoother, more engaging and more efficient. It&#39;s the artist in me that&#39;s compelled to craft work that people enjoy consuming. Yet it is that very consumerism that bothered me. It is as if I enjoy building an aesthetically beautiful bus with sleekest features and comfortable arrangements, but when I visit India I want to experience a rickety one with no doors that slows down, but never stop at the bus stops. Who am I to deny Indians or any other people the luxuries work like mine creates and I enjoy? </p>

<p>There must be a way to take advantage of the traditions of the dying world with the advancements of the modern one...</p>

<p>unplugged from the environment around them  </p>

<p>2 things that bothered me about koregon park:
    1. People lived really wealthily in an otherwise very poor country, which is unjust
    2. Even if the material inequality was bridged, something cultural is dying...
        - pros of culture: 
            - connected people to the earth
            - communal society has good aspects; less self centered or at least a society that is more individualistic like in the US tends to applaud selfishness or at least self centeredness and the consumerism that comes with constantly chasing self-gratification; it is more expected to sacrifice your interests for your family or village in India than in the US- leads to material excess, where most desires are met, yet there is an emptiness to life- a spiritual void
            - life is slower
        - cons of culture are litterally the flip side of that:
            - so many preventable diseases; feeding more
            - forced marriages; identity politics...different communities don&#39;t give a shit about eachother
            - inefficient systems- there is a sense of apathy of overall systemic change beyond immediate concerns- corruption is viewed like bad weather the unfortunate result of natural phenomenon-something that cannot be controlled
    3. There must be a way to take advantage of both the modern and ancient
    4...</p>

<hr>

<p>I want to feel the pollution in my hair and wade through the traffic. I want to experience life when the air is not conditioned, and your time is owned by buracrats and delayed busses. Life happens in the inbetween times. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that the earth isn&#39;t beautiful in America, it&#39;s that the way the majority of people lead their lives is so distant from it. </p>

<p>-Historic monuments in India offer two prices, the Indian price vs. foreignor price...
    -the residents of KP both native and foreign should be paying the foreign price because their world is so different</p>

<p>Koregon park is like visiting the airport. It&#39;s a sanitized and bland reflection of India.</p>

<p>To experience India, I would walk home from work... talk about feeling alive in India. Nothing like drinking fresh mosambi, sweet lime, in hot marati afternoon, </p>

<p>America is so overconsumption...</p>

<p>On the same walk home I saw a woman fully veiled walking through an Indian market and another in short shorts and a tank top step out of a luxury car. My mind was buzzing with thoughts of the privelages, gender expectations, disparities, the benefits and drawbacks of the changing India, the religious and socio-economic forces at play that caused this stark contrast. It occured to me that this contrast is the flint that sparks the fire this country counjours in my mind. That fire can give energy and warmth, but this time it burned.</p>

<p>Though the scope of this post is centered around the cultural implication the IT sector in India, I do want to mention that ThoughtWorks University was an awesome experience. I learned so much, valued it way more than my college, and became really close friends with people across the world.</p>
