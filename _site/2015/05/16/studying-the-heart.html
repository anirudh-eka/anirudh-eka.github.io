<div style="display: none">
when a perfectionist dies <br/>
so the perfection remains
like this universe was beautiful <br/>
before I ever came
I've got nothin to claim <br/>
not even the place where I stay
because if you give a fish <br/>
a bowl you take its ocean away
if they asked what I've learned <br/>
tell em its as simple as this
anger is just fear <br/>
clenched in a fist
Learning to let go <br/>
is what it means to resist
I've learned, to have the mind of an elder <br/>
with the heart of a child
I live in a cage, <br/>
but I was born to be wild
And Freedom, ain't nothin, but <br/>
staring down fear with a smile
All the while, to love myself fully <br/>
and not just for the positive things
For When I grew wings,  <br/>
they said they were proud.
They adorned them in jewels so heavy  <br/>
I could never leave the ground.
That's why I'd rather be a pidgin than a peacock,  <br/>
A feather too many, is too heavy for me
Don't sweeten my air with sugar,  <br/>
because I like it when I can breath
a feather could be a tether <br/>
just as much as it is a key
It's better to give it to someone with lesser <br/>
than letting it hold me down by my greed
Cuz the fruits that I eat, <br/>
are the product of someone else's hard work
I've learned, that the guilt of privilege hurts, <br/>
ignorance is the most painful of losses
But it doesn't compare to the pain <br/>
the cost of that privilege causes
Compassion can build solidarity <br/>
pity is a narrow way to feel tall
If you grow like a red wood,  <br/>
you may scrape the sun for a moment, <br/>
but you are destined to fall
But, if you grow like a banyan tree, <br/>
in every leaf in the forest <br/>
you feel the light through us all
I've learned, the furthest you can travel <br/>
is to the corners of your mind
Genius is not something you have, <br/>
But it is something that you find
But most of all, I've learned, <br/>
I was never a poet <br/>
in all that I've written
I've just been trying to interpret <br/>
the metaphor that we live in
So to all I've been given, <br/>
Since my journey's begun
Every stroke of my pen <br/>
Every breath in my lung
Is a thank you <br/>
in the voice of the dumb
