      <p><p>I&#39;m finally going to leave Facebook. I&#39;ve been slowly transitioning away from it and focusing my energy into my own <a href="http://toomanynames.com">site</a>, but held on to it under the pretense of advertizing to &quot;friends&quot; when I write new articles. My original plan was to get my website a sizable following then leave. Then I started asking myself: How much? Will I ever know? Why do I want to know that many many people want to know what I have to say? Why am I seeking that validation? Would I be willing to sacrifice  my integrity for it?</p>

      <p><p>Ten months ago I was reaching the end of my second year as an Economics Research Assistant and was facing the question of whether I should go to graduate school. I looked at few programs, but I couldn&#39;t bring myself to write the college essays. I didn&#39;t want go selling myself again so that a bunch of folks can decide to give me the privilege to pay them.</p>

      <p><p>When I landed, the humidity barged through the air conditioned Delhi airport and into my nostrils warning of the fast approaching country. I couldn&#39;t believe ThoughtWorks, my company, was sending me to India, the country I was born in, to attend a 5 week training course for new entry level hires from across the world. I felt like I was getting away with a crime. </p>
