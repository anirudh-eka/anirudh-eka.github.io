      <li><span class='meta'>17 May 2015</span><h2><a href="/general/programmer/poet/2015/05/17/welcome_to_toomanynames.html">My Graduate Degree</a></h2></li>
      <p><p>Ten months ago I was reaching the end of my second year as an Economics Research Assistant and was facing the question of whether I should go to graduate school. I looked at few programs, but I couldn&#39;t bring myself to write the college essays. I didn&#39;t want go selling myself again so that a bunch of folks can decide to give me the privilege to pay them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s safe to say my undergraduate experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I went to a private top-20 university and received good grades, but beyond having professors write me recommendations, I was provided no support in getting an internship or a job. Still, I was one of the lucky ones. I got a job in a recession(fittingly, in economic research), which my university could happily advertise as justification for their expensive service.</p>

<p>Their general lack of support in my job search could all be overlooked if the university experience made me significantly more prepared to succeed at work. Though a background in Economics was necessary for context, on a day-to-day basis I found that work mainly entailed writing computer programs, a skill I picked up on the job. It reminded me of a concept in economics called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)#The_result">signaling</a>. The theory argues that (formal) education signals to an employer that an individual has a higher ability and therefore individuals with higher abilities will likely pursue education. Which leads to the question: did Emory make me smart or because I was smart or capable (whatever that means) did I go to Emory?</p>

<p>It&#39;s very difficult to parse out how much schooling has shaped my mind from how much it has evaluated it for future employers. I did perform much better in university then I did in public school, which on the surface may seem like evidence for the former, but I believe I did better because I got to spend more time away from the classroom than ever before. Public school was a cross between a prison, a day care, and an actual place of learning. All the busy work gave me a ton of opportunities to prove that I was lazy, but none to take the time to explore the things I was interested in because I was too slow. </p>

<p>I used the free time in college to pursue a life changing practice: Spoken Word poetry. Though I never considered it as work, the amount of effort I put into crafting pieces was unmatched by my work as an employee or a student. I didn&#39;t just learn the craft. I learned about myself, my ego, love, true humility, privilege, histories, the way I think, my weaknesses, how I learn best and coming to terms with who I am. These were the most important lessons I learned during my college years. None of which I learned in a lecture. Of course none of this mattered in the &quot;real world&quot;, or so I thought. </p>

<p>I moved to DC in 2011, and led a dual life of working a government job by day, and performing at open mics by night- a lifestyle that in someways reflected the dual identity of the city. </p>

<p>On one side there was the House of Cards DC of the Federal government, contractors and NGO headquarters. On the other side was the local population&#39;s DC. The people who worked for the major internationally recognized institution that dotted the city had exposure and wealth that felt like a world away from the native residents. The contrast was was black and white (and Latino), literally. Of the 50 states and 1 District in the United States, the District of Columbia ranks as the most unequal by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_Gini_coefficient#List_of_U.S._states_by_Gini_coefficient_of_income_inequality">Gini Coefficient</a>.</p>

<p>The line between those two DC&#39;s cut through my office. On one side there were the administrators and routine workers, who were predominately black or latino, and on the other there were the researchers, policy makers, and their assistants like me, who were predominantly white.</p>

<p>The line cut through the city steadily marching east as, like in many US cities, young professionals and interns spearheaded the gentrification. I lived on that border, shared my heart at open mics on that border. I was a European in Moccasins, an invader trying to pass off as a native. Though the poetry community was incredibly welcoming to me, I could never shake the guilt of privilege as I heard the troubled stories of growing up in this city from it&#39;s youth. How little access they had to the abundant opportunity this city offered to some. I thought of what kept many of the locals from having my job in their city. I thought about how I was using my university degree as a pass into a career path though it didn&#39;t impart me with any knowledge I couldn&#39;t have gained from Wikipedia, Coursera, and on the job training. It became apparent that the issue with education is not just about me being ripped off, but the perpetuation of a growing inequality in this country. </p>

<p>It is not just the financial barrier of entry into university that has kept the natives of DC at bay, but also the exposure, examples, direction, and support that living in poverty rarely allows. If my parents gave up on me when I was nearly failing middle school I wouldn&#39;t have been qualified to get into the universities that I did.</p>

<p>Programming gave me hope. As I mentioned earlier, I picked up coding on the job (though not very well). I noticed that when I coded I felt like I was playing with legos or writing poetry. In programming I saw a tangible skill that allowed me to be creative, to build things. At this time I started my first tumblr blog and played with the CSS, HTML and (a little) JavaScript to make it look fancy, which I picked up from <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codeacademy</a> and a few other resources. I was learning a substantial skill that was in high demand for absolutely free. In this process I saw an opportunity to forge a new, alternate path to education.</p>

<p>When I entered college for my undergrad I felt like I had no discernible talent, no idea what I wanted to do, and at the same time didn&#39;t want to be left behind. College has become the default path, which is ridiculous. In no other circumstance would someone buy something that could cost up to $50,000 a year without getting a sample of the service. It&#39;s like buying a car without test-driving it, or even knowing what you&#39;re going to use it for.</p>

<p>Ten months ago, I faced the same prospect of going back to college, but this time I had the experience of spoken word, &quot;the real world&quot;, what college is, and coding. I decided I was going to make my own graduate program.</p>

<p>It started with <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> (If you&#39;re interested in a review check it out <a href="http://poetprogrammer.tumblr.com/post/63547885951/dev-bootcamp-reflection">here</a>). Now ten months after leaving my job, I have started a new one as a developer at ThoughtWorks, an organization that seeks to revolutionize IT and advocate for social and economic justice, while maintaining a sustainable business. This next phase of my graduate experience begins with a &quot;study abroad&quot; trip to ThoughtWorks University in Pune, India. Yes, they&#39;re PAYING me to go to the motherland to learn a practical, in demand skill! That&#39;s better than a scholarship.</p>

<p>If I could advise my younger self, I would tell him think about what really motivates you. What do you excel in? If you&#39;re creative what are the ways creativity intersects with making a livelihood? I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t go to college; just go when you&#39;re passion has exhausted the other resources and it seems to be the logical next step. If you do poorly in whatever educational institution you&#39;re in, understand it only proves that you are not designed to excel in that system and nothing more. Don&#39;t let it make you think you&#39;re mentally inferior. Intelligence is not something you have, it&#39;s something you find. Work hard in their system, but beware of sacrificing what makes you exceptional. As Mark Twain once said (or at least has been said to have said), </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve never let my school interfere with my education.&quot;</p>

<p>Take control of your education. You were always your own teacher. Knowledge can be served to you in a book, through a person in front of a classroom, on the internet, in music, in love, but it is ultimately up to you if and how you will use an experience to educate yourself. </p>

<p>I would like to finish by saying that this all might seem like a story of triumph, but it was not without uncertainty. I am well aware that it is because of my privilege that I could afford to do something as risky as this. I had so much support from so many loved ones all my life. However, I believe in the age of Wikipedia, and Kahn Academy there is no reason our society should deny others who do not have my privileges the opportunity to learn and be creative because they didn&#39;t have the exposure or foresight to plan a &quot;successful&quot; career.</p>

      <li><span class='meta'>17 May 2015</span><h2><a href="/india,/programmer/2015/05/17/twu_post.html">TWU review</a></h2></li>
      <p><p>When I landed, the humidity barged through the air conditioned Delhi airport and into my nostrils warning of the fast approaching country. I couldn&#39;t believe ThoughtWorks, my company, was sending me to India, the country I was born in, to attend a 5 week training course for new entry level hires from across the world. I felt like I was getting away with a crime. </p>

<p>After a lay over and a domestic flight to Pune, I was on my way to Koregon Park, the neighborhood where I&#39;d be living for the next 5 weeks. Through stop and go traffic, I glimpsed cocunut trees shoot up like rockets into the sky bursting into a plethora of branches. In the morning I watched a blood sunrise through humid air and listened to subtropical birds sing. In every trip, this is the way India begins for me. I land sometime at night and thanks to jet lag, I witness life unravel starting with the bird song. But this time something was missing. I couldn&#39;t pin point what it was. The old curtains lifted but the show was not the same. This post is an attempt at explaining this difference and why it bothered me so much.</p>

<p>Koregon Park is a posh neighborhood near the major tech companies in the city. It&#39;s a 15 minute shuttle ride to the ThoughtWorks office, which is situated in an area full of tall, clean, well organized buildings that could&#39;ve immigrated from the West. I heard about places like this before. Tech companies have had a large and lasting presence in Hyderabad, the city I often visit and where most of my family is, but I never spent time in that world. And it really is a different world. Audis and BMWs were standard. The Indian residents dressed in a camoflouge that made them indistinguishable from the expats roaming the street. The neighborhood had more Italian restraunts than Indian ones. I think it&#39;s possible for someone to fly into Pune, live in Koregon park, and go to work in one of the big IT companies down the road without ever seeing a cow in the street! </p>

<p>I found myself often saying, &quot;this isn&#39;t the real India.&quot; I hated that phrase, as if there is a way India should be. Yet, I felt the urge to show the foreignors on my trip that most of India doesn&#39;t live with undisturbed electricity and water. But is India supposed to be a poor country? Certainly that&#39;s what I was implying. Koregon Park like so much of &quot;hip&quot; India is trying to be western so bad that it hurts. It offers bars, western restraunts, Hard Rock Cafe, clubs as if yelling to the foreignors (and the rich locals) that India is cool too! You can have a good time here! Sure India can offer that, but it can also offer so much more. Things you couldn&#39;t find anywhere else in the world. If the experience you&#39;re looking for is to go to a subtropical place to party and drink then I&#39;d suggest going to Miami.</p>

<p>India&#39;s soul is still somewhere in a village or a jungle where electricity and water is scarce and siphened for the wealthy in the city enforcing an artificial belief that these resources are infinite. Maharashtra, the state Pune is in, was grappling with the effects of the 2013 drought, which the government claimed had surpassed the historically cruel drought of 1972. However, <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-drought-manmade-analysis/article4577079.ece">unequal distribution of water by the state through dams</a>, which prioritizes..., also deserves blame for causing a desperate situation for rural people. But in the places I lived, the drought seemed like it was in a far away country. The hotels of Pune and surrounding areas offered swimming pools and free bottled water, while farmers beg the clouds for drops and commit suicide not too far away.</p>

<p>If I sound depressing, it is because the situation is depressing. I&#39;m fully aware my actions, in fact sheer amount of resources I required to live a semblance of a first world life in a third world country contradicts all of my preaching. But that&#39;s my point. I want people to feel the guilt of first world privelages and the hypocrisy of claiming to live a just life in an unjust world, when they come to India. For there to be rich, there must be poor and India, like any developing country, can show what exactly is the cost of comfort. But on this trip, I saw how the tech scene tries to hide the rest of the country from its guests.</p>

<p>Still, Koregon Park is in India. Tin roofed shaks sit across a river from the Westin Hotel. Material disparity is still not nearly as hidden from the rich or the poor as it is in the US. When I landed in Chicago at the end of my trip, I saw another Westin Hotel, but this time without the slums of the city to accompany it. The gated community of America keeps the guilt of privelage at bay. I appreciate that India doesn&#39;t as much, but I fear it will.</p>

<p>But what what was missing from the mornings at Koregon Park wasn&#39;t poverty per se, but something linked. Something that became apparent as I watched the morning unfold at my grandparent&#39;s home in Hyderabad. Chasing the morning bird song, a distant call to prayer echoed from a Masjid and, bells rang in temples and homes as poojas welcomed the sunrise. This is what I love about India. The day begins for all creatures of the city. Women pour water in front of houses, and lay chalk powder designs on the ground. Shop keepers perform rituals with their merchandise praying for a good &quot;harvest&quot;. In the park, old men practice Yoga and meditation. God, an essential part of Indian culture, was what was missing from Koregon Park. In my time there I did not see a single religious institution. (I don&#39;t count Osha Ashram.) I personally am not religous, but I am always facinated by how spiritual traditions in India, of which there are millions, lace through all aspects of society and life. If there is anything that ties the people to their earth, you can feel it in these traditions. The cycles of the days, seasons, lives, eons are painted into ritual and festival.</p>

<p>It is possible that Koregon Park was always like how it is. But it feels as though when they developed the area to attract the rich and the foreignors, they gentrified God out of the neighborhood. In its place they built restraunts that serve pork and beef handled by brown people who could very likely be Muslims or Hindus. But money is God in the flesh. It has the power to make an IT office in the subtropics feel like a winter in Chicago. With the (unequal) advance of modern technology into India, more and more Indians are being able to control their world. Cars, air conditioning, washing machines, hydroelctric dams are making the earth more of a slave than a god. My issue with Koregon Park, I suppose, is really an issue with a grander march of our species to control our environment.</p>

<p>Though urbanizing rapidly, India is still mostly an Agrarian society with a rural population of nearly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_India">70%</a>. It is the communal lifestyle of the village, which penetrates into city life as well, that makes the country&#39;s culture so distinct from the West. </p>

<p>I write code. I&#39;m at the forefront of the human crusade to control. I continuously strive to make the consumer&#39;s experience smoother, more engaging and more efficient. It&#39;s the artist in me that&#39;s compelled to craft work that people enjoy consuming. Yet it is that very consumerism that bothered me. It is as if I enjoy building an aesthetically beautiful bus with sleekest features and comfortable arrangements, but when I visit India I want to experience a rickety one with no doors that slows down, but never stop at the bus stops. Who am I to deny Indians or any other people the luxuries work like mine creates and I enjoy? </p>

<p>There must be a way to take advantage of the traditions of the dying world with the advancements of the modern one...</p>

<p>unplugged from the environment around them  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">I got in the habit of walking home from work just to remind myself that I was still in India.

<p>2 things that bothered me about koregon park:
    1. People lived really wealthily in an otherwise very poor country, which is unjust
    2. Even if the material inequality was bridged, something cultural is dying...
        - pros of culture: 
            - connected people to the earth
            - communal society has good aspects; less self centered or at least a society that is more individualistic like in the US tends to applaud selfishness or at least self centeredness and the consumerism that comes with constantly chasing self-gratification; it is more expected to sacrifice your interests for your family or village in India than in the US- leads to material excess, where most desires are met, yet there is an emptiness to life- a spiritual void
            - life is slower
        - cons of culture are litterally the flip side of that:
            - so many preventable diseases; feeding more
            - forced marriages; identity politics...different communities don&#39;t give a shit about eachother
            - inefficient systems- there is a sense of apathy of overall systemic change beyond immediate concerns- corruption is viewed like bad weather the unfortunate result of natural phenomenon-something that cannot be controlled
    3. There must be a way to take advantage of both the modern and ancient
        - Liken to Brazil&#39;s fast paced &quot;development&quot; before the World cup that leave&#39;s people behind
        - We may not get there quickly, but we&#39;ll get there together</p>

<hr>

<p>I want to feel the pollution in my hair and wade through the traffic. I want to experience life when the air is not conditioned, and your time is owned by buracrats and delayed busses. Life happens in the inbetween times. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that the earth isn&#39;t beautiful in America, it&#39;s that the way the majority of people lead their lives is so distant from it. </p>

<p>-Historic monuments in India offer two prices, the Indian price vs. foreignor price...
    -the residents of KP both native and foreign should be paying the foreign price because their world is so different</p>

<p>Koregon park is like visiting the airport. It&#39;s a sanitized and bland reflection of India.</p>

<p>To experience India, I would walk home from work... talk about feeling alive in India. Nothing like drinking fresh mosambi, sweet lime, in hot marati afternoon, </p>

<p>America is so overconsumption...</p>

<p>On the same walk home I saw a woman fully veiled walking through an Indian market and another in short shorts and a tank top step out of a luxury car. My mind was buzzing with thoughts of the privelages, gender expectations, disparities, the benefits and drawbacks of the changing India, the religious and socio-economic forces at play that caused this stark contrast. It occured to me that this contrast is the flint that sparks the fire this country counjours in my mind. That fire can give energy and warmth, but this time it burned.</p>

<p>Though the scope of this post is centered around the cultural implication the IT sector in India, I do want to mention that ThoughtWorks University was an awesome experience. I learned so much, valued it way more than my college, and became really close friends with people across the world.</p>
