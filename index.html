				<p>Coconut trees launch from the earth like rockets hurtling towards
American fighter jets flying above, but explode prematurely into an
umbrella of branches and leaves. Inside a ring of observers, a monk sits
in lotus position on the street, as another empties a five gallon
canister of petroleum onto him. He lights a match stick over his lap and
let&#39;s go.</p>

<p>The hungry little fire chews at the wood as the match plummets towards a
surface full of oil like a bomb over Iraq. Like these places are meant
to burn.</p>

				<blockquote>
<p>I am not saying someone who visciously attacks us should not be disciplined. But what is most important is that we first take care of the seeds of negativity in ourselves. Then if someone needs to be helped or disciplined, we will do so out of compassion, not anger and retribution.</p>

<p><strong>- Thich Nhat Hanh</strong>, <em>Peace Is Every Step</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with justice is it often deteriorates into revenge. And revenge is always hungry. They can catch the murderer, sentence her to death, but it still won&#39;t bring back the lives of those she&#39;s killed. It won&#39;t stop the hurt. So we put tougher rules on those that look like the murderer, and live where she lives. We treat those who are innocent as guilty. And one day one of them with all their rightful anger seeks justice, as they see it.</p>
