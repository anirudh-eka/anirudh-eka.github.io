Mondays are meshed with Tuesdays<br/>
and the week with the whole year.<br/>
Time cannot be cut<br/>
with your weary scissors,<br/>
and all the names of the day<br/>
are washed out by the waters of night.<br/>

No one can claim the name of Pedro,<br/>
nobody is Rosa or Maria,<br/>
all of us are dust or sand,<br/>
all of us are rain under rain.<br/>
They have spoken to me of Venezuelas,<br/>
of Chiles and of Paraguays;<br/>
I have no idea what they are saying.<br/>
I know only the skin of the earth<br/>
and I know it is without a name.<br/>

When I lived amongst the roots<br/>
they pleased me more than flowers did,<br/>
and when I spoke to a stone<br/>
it rang like a bell.<br/>

It is so long, the spring<br/>
which goes on all winter.<br/>
Time lost its shoes.<br/>
A year is four centuries.<br/>

When I sleep every night,<br/>
what am I called or not called?<br/>
And when I wake, who am I<br/>
if I was not while I slept?<br/>

This means to say that scarcely<br/>
have we landed into life<br/>
than we come as if new-born;<br/>
let us not fill our mouths<br/>
with so many faltering names,<br/>
with so many sad formallities,<br/>
with so many pompous letters,<br/>
with so much of yours and mine,<br/>
with so much of signing of papers.<br/>

I have a mind to confuse things,<br/>
unite them, bring them to birth,<br/>
mix them up, undress them,<br/>
until the light of the world<br/>
has the oneness of the ocean,<br/>
a generous, vast wholeness,<br/>
a crepitant fragrance.<br/>
