Then if someone needs to be helped or disciplined, we will do so out of compassion, not anger and retribution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Thich Nhat Hanh</strong>, <em>Peace Is Every Step</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem with justice is it often deteriorates into revenge. And revenge is always hungry. They can catch the murderer, sentence her to death, but it still won&#39;t bring back the lives of those she&#39;s killed. It won&#39;t stop the hurt. So we put tougher rules on those that look like the murderer, and live where she lives. We treat those who are innocent as guilty. And one day one of them with all their rightful anger seeks justice, as they see it.</p>\n\n<p><span style='display: none;'></p>\n",
