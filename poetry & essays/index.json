His tummy grumbles. </p>\n\n<p>The other airplane passengers fill the cabin with the smell of his grandmother’s cooking. They are like spices in the belly of an adventurous bird that must be cursing at itself for gorging on Indian food before traveling half way across the world. </p>\n\n<p>The pungent pilgrims are just as eager as the bird to be defecated onto America: the land of the water fountain. Enveloped in a milky moonlight, they sail through hills of cotton searching for comfort. </p>\n\n<p>Through the window the baby’s mother watches the moon run with them, perhaps because it is also not full. She is worried again. Did she make the right choice? Do they have rice in America? Will they see a better life? </p>\n\n<p>Doubt is the irritating reminder that God keeps secrets.
