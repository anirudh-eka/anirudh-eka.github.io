Just got my hands on [50 Shades of BLACK](http://www.50shadesofblack.com/ "50 Shades website"). I feel honored to be part of this publication. Much thanks [Carlton Mackey] (http://www.carltonmackey.com) for giving me a platform to join the dialog about Race and Sexuality in America. Also thanks [Will McInerney] (https://twitter.com/will_mci) for taking this picture (yea he's a dope poet and photographer).
