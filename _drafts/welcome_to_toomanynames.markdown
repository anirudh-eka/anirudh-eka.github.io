Ten months ago I was reaching the end of my second year as an Economics Research Assistant, I was facing the perenial concern, "what do I do next." Typically, RAs go to graduate school to further their education, but I couldn't bring myself to write the college essay. I didn't want go selling myself again so that a bunch of folks can decide to give me the privelage to pay them. (There are certainly scholarships, but full-rides are available to small number of the entire student population.)

In fact, I loathed most of my schooling experience because of the pressure to prove my intelligence based on a standardized grading system. 

"I never let education get in the way of my learning"

Public school is a cross between a prison, a day care, and an actual place of learning. All the busy work gave me a ton of opportunities to prove that I was lazy, but none to take the time to explore things I was interested in (because I was too slow). What if intellegence is not something you have, but something you find? What if a test is a way for a teacher to asses how effective their teaching was and not a way to determine the aptitude of their student? I left school feeling I had no discernable talent, no idea what I wanted to do, and at the sametime didn't want to be left behind. 

In other words, I was the perfect candidate for college! College, or our culture's view of college, sells folks this false sense of security that "if you pay for this service we will let you figure out what you're interested in and make you into successful professional in that field." 

It's a proposterous idea. In no other circumstance would someone buy something that could cost upto $50,000 a year without getting a sample of the service. Colleges are often judged on a very confused ranking system that puts alot of weight on how many rockstar professors, papers published, funding for state of the art facilities they have, and not nearly as much on whether the professor can actually teach you something.It's like buying a car without test-driving it, or even knowing when you're going to use it.

If I could advise my younger self, I would tell him think about what really motivates you, what do you excel in, if you're creative what are the ways creativity intersects with making a livelihood. 

I'm not saying don't go to college; just go when you're passion has exhausted the other resources and it seems to be the logical next step. It was well put in Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenence:

Anyway 10 months ago, I had the choice to go into that system again or find something else. On

Take control of your education. You were always your own teacher. Knowledge can be served to you in a book, through a person in front of a classroom, on the internet, in music, in love, but it is ultimately up to you if and how you will use an experience to educate yourself. 

As viscious as this might seem, I'm not actually against college itself, but the place it has taken in our culture. I think places of learning and research should be supported without government or corporate interests. I think certain people should be education in those places of cutting edge research. But not every researcher is a good teacher, and that's ok. 

I also would like to say that I had some incredible teachers and professors throughout my schooling. I also have a few friends that are teachers and I thoroughly appreciate their passion in the classroom. Too often I hear that they succeed to reach kids not because of the system but despite it.

Late 2012 I started my first blog on tumblr. It was a time of duality. I had graduated college a year prior and worked a government job in DC by day, and performed spoken word poetry by night. I worked to live and lived after work.

DC had a dual life too. One of the Federal government, and the other of it's local population. The contrast was was white and black (and latino) literally. Of the 50 states and 1 District in the United States, the District of Columbia ranks as the most unequal by the Gini Coefficient (link). The people who worked for the major internationally recognized institution in the city had exposure and wealth that felt like a world away from the native residents.

The line between those two DC's cut through my office. On one side there were the administrators, janitors and other routine workers, who were predominately black, and on the other there were the researchers, policy makers, and their assistants like me, who were predominantly white.

The line cut through the city steadily marching east as, like in many US cities, young professionals and interns spearheaded the gentrification. I lived on that border, shared my heart at open mics with people on that border. I was a European in Moccasins, an invader trying to pass off as a native. Though the poetry community was incredibly welcoming to me, I could never shake the guilt of privilege as I heard the stories of growing up in city from it's youth. How little access they had to the abundant opportunity this city offered to some. I thought of what kept many of the locals from having my job in their city. 

They probably didn't have a degree (with a pretty good GPA) from a top-20 private university. But I knew I didn't work too hard in college and my fellow students rarely stuck me as geniuses. Most of us were privileged (upper-)middle class kids, who payed exorbitantly for the security of a good job that college seems to hustle to folks these days.

I didn't think it was just the financial barrier of entry to university that kept the natives of DC at bay, but the exposure, examples, direction, support that living in poverty rarely allows. 

I knew the education system was broken and my University robbed me. I knew if my parents gave up on me I wouldn't have qualified to get into those schools because I did terribly in public school. I grew up thinking I was an idiot until I finally started doing pretty well in college. If I gave up, the current education system would not be forgiving if I later changed my mind and decided to learn.

I knew that work on a day-to-day basis didn't utilize my four years studying Economics as much as what I learned on the job, a huge component of which was coding. 

As I worked, it occurred to me that coding is an art. It felt like playing with legos or writing poetry. In programming I saw a tangible skill that allowed me to be creative, to build things that were substantial. 

At this time I started my first tumblr blog and played with the CSS, HTML and (a little) JavaScript to make it look fancy, which I picked up mainly from Codeacademy(link). I was learning a substantial skill that was in high demand for absolutely free. This is where I saw hope for a change in education.

I knew I couldn't in full conscience go to graduate school. Not when I saw so many people denied opportunities because they didn't even have the undergraduate degree that I had. I wanted to prove that the things I build, not the institutions I pay validate my knowledge. 

Though I have nothing against those who follow a traditional education route (and there are many incredibly intelligent, hard working people I admire who do), I believe there is something uniquely rewarding about teaching oneself.

I "taught" myself poetry and until recently I felt it was the only thing I excelled at. I didn't just learn the craft. I learned about myself, my ego, love, true humility, privilege, histories, the way I think, my weaknesses, how I learn best and coming to terms with who I am. If I am creatively inspired, I work hard. I worked hard as a poet for mostly free, but adequately as an employee and student. 

When I discovered coding, I found a field where I could be creative, and at the same time make a bit of money. How could I turn that down? 

By spring of last year I was finishing my second year as a Research Assistant. Typically, RAs go to graduate school to further their education. I decided I was going to make my own graduate school education.

It started with Dev Bootcamp(link) for which I started my second blog (link). Now ten months after leaving my job, I am about to start a new one as a developer at ThoughtWorks, an organization that seeks to revolutionize IT and advocate for social and economic justice, while maintaining a sustainable business. 

This next phase of my graduate experience begins with a "study abroad" trip to ThoughtWorks University in Pune, India. Yes, they're PAYING me to go to the motherland!! :) 

As I am now a developer, I thought it would be fitting to document this experience in a blog that I built myself (well sort of-  I am using Jekyll(link) on GitHub pages. It's super cool and runs totally using text files to store the data!)

I would like to finish by saying that this all might seem like a story of triumph, but it was not without uncertainty. I am well aware that it is because of my privilege that I could afford to do something as risky as this. I had so much support from so many loved ones all my life. I will never feel that my work is done until I can help those who did not have the luck I have had. There is a lot to discuss about how to achieve that that I will save for later, but for now I give the world toomanynames.com!
