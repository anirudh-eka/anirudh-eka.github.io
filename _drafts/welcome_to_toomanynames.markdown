Early last year I started my first blog(s) on tumblr. It was a time of duality. I had graduated college a year prior and worked a government job in DC by day, and performed spoken word poetry by night. I worked to live and lived after work. By "lived" I mean being creative and expressing myself honestly. 

DC had a dual life too. The life of the Federal government, and the life of it's local population. The differences between them is white and black (and latino) literally. The inequality is stark. Of the 50 states and 1 Distric in the United States, the District of Columbia ranks as the most inequal by the Gini Coefficient. The people who worked for the major internationally recognized institution in the city had exposure and wealth that was rarely accessable to the native resident.

The line between those two DC's cut through my office. On one side there were the administrators, janitors and other routine jobs, who were predominately black, and on the other there were the researchers, policy makers, and their assistants like me, who were predominantly white.

The line cut through the city steadily marching east as, like in many US cities, young professionals and unpaid interns led the gentrification. I lived on that border, shared my heart with people on that border. I was a European in Mokasins, an invader trying to pass off as a native.Though the poetry community was incredibly welcoming to me, I could never shake the guilt of privelage as I heard the stories of children growing up in city. How little access they had to the abundant opportunity this city offered to some.

I thought of what kept the locals from having my job. Well they didn't have a degree (with a pretty good GPA) from a top-20 private university. But I knew I didn't work too hard in college and my fellow students rarely stuck me as geniuses. Most of us were privelaged (upper-)middle class kids, who payed exorbatently for the security of a good job that college seems to hustle to folks these days.

I didn't think it was just the financial barrier of entry to university that kept the natives of DC at bay, but the exposure, examples, direction, support that living in poverty rarely allows. 

I knew the education system was broken and my University robbed me. I knew if my parents gave up on me I wouldn't have qualified to get into those schools because I did terribly in public school. I grew up thinking I was an idiot until I finally started doing pretty well in college. If I gave up, the current education system would not be forgiving if I later changed my mind and decided to learn.

I knew that work on a day-to-day basis didn't utilize my four years studying Economics as much as what I learned on the job, a huge component of which was coding. In programming I saw hope! In programming I saw the ability to be creativity, to build things that were substantial. It felt like playing with legos. 

At this time I started my first tumbler blog and played with the CSS, HTML and (a little) JavaScript to make it look fancy. I learned from Codeacademy, and by doing. I was learning a substantial skill that was in high demand for absolutely free. This is where I saw hope for a change in education.

I knew I couldn't in full conscience go to graduate school. Not when I saw so many people denied opportunity because they didn't even have the undergraduate degree that I had. I wanted to prove that the things I built, not the institutions I pay validate my knowledge. 

Though I have nothing against those who follow a traditional education route (and there are many incredibly intellegent, hard working people I admire who do), I believe there is something uniquely rewarding about teaching yourself.

I "taught" myself poetry and until recently I felt it was the only thing I excelled at. I didn't just learn the craft. I learned about myself, my ego, love, true humility, privelage, histories, the way I think, my weaknesses, how I learn best and coming to terms with who I am. If I am creatively inspired, I work hard. I worked hard as a poet for mostly free, but adequately as an employee and student. 

When I discovered coding, I found an industry that was willing to appreciate that kind of hard work (at least compared to other fields I was exposed to). 

By spring of last year I was finishing my second year as a Research Assistant. Typically, RAs go to graduate school to further their education. I decided I was going to make my own graduate school education.

It started with Dev Bootcamp for which I started my second blog (link). Now ten months after leaving my job, I am about to start a new one as a developer at ThoughtWorks, an organization that seeks to revolutionize IT and advocate for social and economic justice, while maintaining a sustainable business. 

This next phase of my graduate experience begins with a "study abroad" trip to ThoughtWorks University in Pune, India. Yes, they're PAYING me to go to the motherland!! :) 

As I am now a developer, I thought it would be fitting to document this experience in a blog that I built myself (well sort of-  I am using Jekyll(link) on github pages. It's super cool and runs totally using text files to store the data!)

I would like to finish by saying that this all might seem like a story of triumph, but it was not without uncertainty. I am well aware that it is because of my privelage that I could afford to do something as risky as this. I had so much support from so many loved ones all my life. I will never feel that my work is done until I can help those who did not have the luck I have had. There is alot to discuss about how to achieve that that I will save for later, but for now I give the world toomanynames.com!
