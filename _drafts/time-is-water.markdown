It used to bother me when people said don't waste time. I thought it couldn't coexist with living in the present. I interpreted it as being excessively goal oriented and impatient when things aren't working. 

But it doesn't have to mean that. Wasting time is letting it trickle away on Facebook, on frivolous and fleeting things, 

Time is like a pot of water that you mean to pour into a tub. Focus establishes the sturdiness of the pot. If you have weak focus the pot will leak. You will loose time. Time you wanted to pour into something worth while.


I find the time when I'm by myself, I'm not really alone. Too often Facebook is the hook pulling me in.
